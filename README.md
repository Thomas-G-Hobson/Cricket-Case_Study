# Cricket-Case_Study
During my playing days as a professional cricket I experienced a lack of analysis as a player in a new union.
My goal is to create that awareness at the union and help them move towards acquiring the skills of one. 
In this analysis case study I have gotten insights in the team I was part of. Here I have gone and compared everyones season to each other, shown how I can analyze a player and how it would be useful to them, as well as analyzing the ground that they might play at.
